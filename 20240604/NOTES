why isn't gnomonic distance preserving? do a derivative argument to find out?

NOTES: mention feh key changes for zooming

NOTED: messing with emacs highlight

CSPICE determine solar elevation for all pixels how fast? (then overlay w transparency?)

jeff-Virtual-Machine:~> xplanet -window -geometry 1600x1350 -projection merc -num_times 1 -output /tmp/bg0.png && convert -crop 1600x900+0+135 /tmp/bg0.png /tmp/bg1.png && gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri 'file:///tmp/bg1.png'

(added to cron, created)

localtime 12 was the magic option

use markerfile created by Python tz script for xplanet?

(or overlay timezones?)

shortcut to show bg image?

maybe writeup common reddit replies on stream and refer people to them ideas:

  - can't draw perfect geometric figures w pen and paper not 0 thickness

  - mechanical objects cant exceed speed of light using leverage

  - stuff that people should invent (lazy enterpenaur site?)

  - science is an epistimology

  - us not a democracy

  - no global warming (but I won't fight it on stream)
