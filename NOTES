Concerns:

  - Is xterm font too small?

  - does video appear choppy?

github link promiment, twitch.tv link (which will link to others)

Problem: viewers can not see mouse

ticker instead of bg image (fade in/out to avoid animation issues?)

Organization by date (of git)

cheating (have done this before)

First first stream: setup

First stream different, catch up; then on rubberduck

naturalearthdata, qgis, sr_sov_s3

gdal_rasterize do it wrong first (no -t option) then right

overlay on OSM, but wrong equiangular, do mercator (with -t)

write python code using ckdtree (explain why needed)

show colorization

increase res from 256x256 to much higher

more... incl maybe GRASS GIS and voronoi intro

"dconf dump /" will dump all dconf settings

dconf read /org/gnome/shell/extensions/showmethetext/text

for bg image, use OSM map and shrink as I did previously
